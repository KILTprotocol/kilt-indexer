# KILT Indexer

This project builds a customized database with information from the **[KILT Blockchain](https://www.kilt.io/)** , leveraging the robust capabilities of [SubQuery](https://subquery.network) as its backbone.
[SubQuery](https://subquery.network) provides the generic framework for collecting, processing, and storing data from chain node interactions, which we then tailor specifically for this project.
The processed data is made available for customers to query via a website or HTTP requests.

The majority of the information collected focuses on **Identity solutions** rather than transactions.
This includes data related to [decentralized identifiers (DIDs)](https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/did) and [verifiable credentials (VCs)](https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/credentials/overview).

You can visit our deployed websites to query information.
It is also possible to run the indexer locally, allowing you to customize it to your needs.
