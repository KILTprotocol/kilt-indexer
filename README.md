# KILT Indexer

This project builds a customized database with information from the [KILT](https://www.kilt.io/) Blockchain, leveraging the robust capabilities of [SubQuery](https://subquery.network) as its backbone.
[SubQuery](https://subquery.network) provides the generic framework for collecting, processing, and storing data from chain node interactions, which we then tailor specifically for this project.
The processed data is made available for customers to query via a website or HTTP requests.

Most of the information collected here is related to Identity solutions, so everything related to [decentralized identifiers (DIDs)](https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/did) and [verifiable credentials](https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/credentials/overview).

You can visit our deployed websites to query information.
It is also possible for you to run the indexer locally and tailor it even further.
